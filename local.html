			Since it opened in 1999, ITB has been involved in many local initiatives to promote education and science in our region, including taster programs for secondary schools and the annual robotics summer school for local primary school children. Over 600 children from 20 primary schools attended Science Week events at ITB. ITB also hosted a very successful talk at the Blanchardstown Library on Digital Photography.
